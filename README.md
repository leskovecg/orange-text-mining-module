# 🧠 Orange Text Mining Module (Bioinformatics Lab, FRI)

This repository contains my work on developing and contributing to a text mining module for [Orange Data Mining](https://orange.biolab.si/), an open-source machine learning and data visualization tool.

🧪 Developed as part of a student project at the Bioinformatics Laboratory, Faculty of Computer and Information Science (FRI), University of Ljubljana.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to expand Orange's text mining capabilities by adding a new widget/module that handles:

- 📝 Text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal)
- 🧠 Embedding generation (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT)
- 📊 Visualization of word frequency and topic modeling
- 🐞 Bug fixing and code contributions to existing Orange modules

---

## 💡 Features

- Widget-based GUI with easy plug-and-play text processing
- Integrated into the Orange framework
- Reuses existing libraries (NLTK, sklearn, gensim)
- Designed for bioinformatics and clinical datasets

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Git/GitHub
- Jupyter for prototyping
